# Running experiments on a cluster with `param_search`

This Python package makes it easy to launch lots of jobs with different parameters to a computing cluster. It also has features to monitor the status of running or completed jobs, aggregate their output, and create some basic visualizations.

See [this Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/mattragoza/ipython-notebooks/blob/master/param_search_example.ipynb) for a walkthrough.
